# Sample data for DuckDB Exploration

The files in this repository accompany my blog posts for exploring DuckDB. The format and organisation are described in the [first part of the posts](https://notepad.onghu.com/2025/exploring-duckdb-part1/).

You are welcome to use the data in any way that you need.
